Web Application
================
A web application is a collection of web resource programs having the capability to generate web pages.

We have two types of web pages.

1) Static web pages 
--------------------
A web page with fixed content is called static web page.
ex:
	home page
	aboutus page
	contactus page
	services page
	and etc.


2) Dynamic web pages
-------------------- 
A web page with no fixed content is called dynamic web page.
ex:
	live cricket score page
	gmail inbox page
	stock market share value page
	and etc.

We have two types of web resource programs.

1) Static web resource program 
----------------------------
A static web resource program is used to create static web pages.
ex:
	Html program
	CSS program
	Bootstrap program
	Angularjs program 
	Reactjs program
	and etc.	

2) Dynamic web resource program
--------------------------------
Dynamic web resource programs are used to develop dynamic web pages.
ex:
	servlet program
	jsp program 
	and etc.

Based on the position and execution these web resources programs are divided into two types.

1) Client side web resource programs
-----------------------------------
A web resource program which executes at client side is called client side web resource program.
ex:
	html program
	css program
	bootstrap program
	angularjs program
	reactjs program
	and etc.

All static web resources programs are called client side web resource programs.


2) Server side web resource programs
-------------------------------------
A web resource program which executes at server side is called server side web resource program.
ex:
	servlet program
	jsp program
	and etc.

All dynamic web resource programs are called server side web resource programs.


Web Application and Web Resource program Execution
===================================================
Java application will execute manually.

Web application and web resource program wille execute at the time when we have requested.Hence there is no chance of executing them separately.

Diagram: servlet1.1

With respect to the diagram:

1) Enduser will give the request to web resource program.

2) Our server will trap that request and it passes that request to appropriate web 
   resource program.

3) Web resource program will execute the logic to process the request.

4) Web resource program will communicate with database software if neccessary.

5) Web resource program will give the output to web server.

6) Web server will send the output to browser window as dynamic response.


Web Server
============
It is a piece of software which is used to automate whole process of web application and web resource program execution.
ex:
	Tomcat , Resin and etc.

Responsibilities of a web server
----------------------------------
1) It takes contineous request from client.

2) It passes that request to appropriate web resource program.

3) It provides environment to deploy or undeploy the web application.

4) It provides middleware services only to deployed web application.

5) It provides environment to execute client side web resource programs at browser 
   window.

6) It takes the output from web resource program and sends to browser window 
   as dynamic response.

7) It automates whole process of web application and web resource program execution.


Web Container
=============
It is a software application or a program which manage whole life cycle of web resource program i.e from birth to death.

Servlet container manage whole life cycle of servlet program.

JSP container manage whole life cycle of jsp program.

Some part of industry considers servlet container and jsp container are web containers.

Every server is designed to support servlet container and jsp container.

Note:
-----
	To execute Java we need JRE/JVM.
	To execute serlvet program we need servlet container.
	To execute jsp program we need jsp container.

Tomcat
========
Server		:	Web server 

Version		:	7.x

Vendor		:	Apache foundation

website		:	www.tomcat.apache.org

Port No		:	8080

servlet container :	catalina 

Jsp container	:	Jasper

Tomcat is a not a container.
It is a server containing servlet container and jsp container.

Before 6.x version tomcat is known as web server. But from 6.x version onwards tomcat is also known as application server.

Tomcat installation will ask following things.

1) Http portno 

2) adminstrative username and password 

3) JRE location (parallel to jdk)

4) Tomcat installation location.


Tomcat server installation
===========================
Double click to tomcat software --> yes --> next --> I agree -->

type of install : Full --> next --> 

Http Connector port : 2525

adminstrator username : admin 
	     password : admin  ---> next --> next --> Install.


How to set tomcat server to manual mode
=======================================
start --> services (view local services) --> Select Apache tomcat --> click to stop link --> double click to Apache tomcat --> startup type : manual --> apply --> ok.
