Limitations with Spring Framework
=================================
In spring framework , a developer is responsible for following things.

1) Add dependencies / jar files 

2) Add Configurations i.e applicationContext.xml 

3) Arranging the virtual server like Tomcat , Weblogic and etc to deploy the web application.

4) Managing the physical database like Oracle, MySQL and etc to communicate with database. 

To overcome these limitations we need to use Spring Boot.


Spring Boot
============
Spring Boot is a java based application framework developed by Pivotal Team.

It provides RAD(Rapid Application Development) features for spring based applications.

It is an open source , production ready grade spring based applications with minimum configurations.

In short , spring boot is a combination of 
ex:
	spring framework + embedded server + embedded database.

Advantages of Spring Boot
============================
> It creates standalone application which can be run by using java -jar.

> It provides production ready grade features like metrics, healthcheck, externalized configuration and etc.

> It provides optionate stater's POM's to simply the MAVEN configuration.

> It does not support XML configurations. Instead we will use Annotations.

> It allows us to test our web applications by using various HTTP servers like Tomcat.We don't need to convert to war file.

> It uses CLI (Command Line Interface) tool for creating and testing the spring boot project.

> It minimize the boiler plate codes and xml configurations.

> It supports number of plugin's.

> It increases productivity and reduces development time.

List of companies are working with spring boot
==============================================

1. Netflix 
2. Alibaba
3. LinkedIn 
4. Uber 
5. Groupon 
6. Zillow 
7. Intuit.
8. welmart and etc.

	@Repository annotation 	


Q) How many ways we can develop spring boot project?

	There are two ways to develop spring boot project.

	1) Using Spring Initializr 

	2) Using IDE's (Spring Tool Suit(STS) / Intellij)


Spring Initializr 
===================
Spring initializr is a based based tool provided by pivotal web services. 

Using spring initializr we can generate create basic structure of a project but it won't add application code.

It offers extensiable API for JVM based projects.

To create a project structure using spring initializr we need to use below url.
ex:
	https://start.spring.io/

Steps to create a spring boot project using spring initializr
----------------------------------------------------------
step1:
-----
	Goto spring initializr web based tool.
	ex:
		https://start.spring.io/

step2:
----
	Create a  spring boot project i.e SBApp1.
	ex:
		Project 	: Maven 
		Language	: Java
		Dependencies	: (no dependencies)
		Spring Boot	: 3.2.1
		 	
		Project Metadata

		Group 		: com.ihub.www	
		Artifact	: SBApp1
		Name		: SBApp1
		description	: First Spring Boot Project
		package 	: com.ihub.www 
		packaging	: jar 
		Java		: 17			

		---> click on generate button.

step3:
----
	Download and Extract STS IDE.

step4:
-----
	Launch STS IDE by choosing workspace location.
	
step5:
------
	Exract SBApp1 project and open the project in STS IDE.
	ex:
		import projects --> Maven --> Existing Maven project --> Next -->
		Root directory --> SBApp1 --> select folder --> finish.		

step6:
-----
	Add some code in SBApp1Application.java file.
	ex:
		System.out.println("I Love Spring Boot");

step7:
-----
	Run spring boot project.
	ex:
		right click on SBApp1 --> run as --> spring boot App.
