	methods
	keywords
	packages & 
	constants 

classes

In java, all packages we need to write under lowercase letters only.
ex:
	predefined packages		userdefined packages
	-------------------		---------------------
	java.lang			ihubtalent
	java.io				com.ihubtalent.www
	java.util			com.google.www 
	java.text			and etc.
	java.util.stream
	and etc.

constants
----------
In java, all constants we need to write under uppercase letters only.

ex:
	predefined constants		Userdefined constants
	-------------------		--------------------
	MAX_PRIORITY			LIMIT 
	NORM_PRIORITY			DEGREE
	MIN_PRIORITY			and etc.
